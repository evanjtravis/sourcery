Some things you may need to know:
    Each makefile templates subdirectory can have multiple templates in it.
    There is, however, one setup makefile just called Makefile. This
    makefile is used to execute basic functions on the makefile templates
    themselves including permissions and possibly setting up environment
    variables specific to the project or task.
