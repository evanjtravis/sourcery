USAGE: pinch [-dhvx] FILENAME LINE-ARGS
DESCRIPTION
    Select lines from FILENAME according to the given LINE-ARGS.

    LINE-ARGS controls which lines in FILENAME are selected.
    LINE-ARGS can be either positive or negative. Negative numbers cause pinch

    LINE-ARGS:
        
        NUM                  single line
        
        STARTLINE..ENDLINE   line range defined by start and end lines
        
        STARTLINE:COUNT      line range defined by start line and line offset.

    OPTIONS:
        -d                    disable logging

        -h                    display this help

        -v                    verbose mode

        -x                    cut (delete) lines from FILENAME

Any number of LINE-ARGS can be supplied to pinch.
The resulting text from all arguments will be aggregated and
